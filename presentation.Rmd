```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Overview

This Shiny application along with the Slidify presentation is created for Coursera course Developing Data Products under the Data Science track.  

The data set involved is the "quakes" base data set under R, which gives the locations of 1000 seismic events of MB > 4.0. The events occurred in a cube near Fiji since 1964.

```{r echo=TRUE}
data("quakes"); head(quakes, 3)
```

## Shiny Application

The Shiny application generated from the "quakes" data set aims to do the followings:

1. Peoople can manually select the magnitude and depth ranges of the earthquakes;
2. the app can locate the selected earthquakes occurred on map;
3. the app can automatically calculate and summary the counts of different earthquake.
